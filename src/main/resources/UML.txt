UML Design

1)Plateau class 
2)Rover class 
3)Enumeration for North, South, East and West. 
4)Enumeration for L (Left Rotation), R (Right Rotation) and M (Move forward one grid point). 
5)Position class to handle the x and y positions on the Plateau.

UML:Dependencies, Associations and Relationships:
The Plateau has to exist before a Rover can exist so there is a one to one relationship between Rover class and Plateau.
Rover cannot exist without a Plateau.
